         <p class="para"> Coding is my favourite Hobby. I like to be popular so I make my own website and apps and then post it. I also make many apps for my fathers refinery buisness as my father is owner so need to give offers online. My most favourite teacher "Prabh Simar Kaur Mam" told me Coding. I loved her way of teaching and helping. She also explained me how coding is helpful. I learnt it in 2020 in Covid-19 from the best coding center "White Hat Jr". It is located in "Mumbai".

      Thanks to a special person "Prabh Simar Kaur Mam". Thanks Prabh Simar Kaur Mam </p>
